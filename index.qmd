Throughout this workshop, you'll explore the nuances of data-driven analysis, from constructing your dataset and formulating research inquiries to learning data visualisation techniques. Along this journey, you'll contemplate the creation of personalised data models tailored to your research queries, navigate potential biases within datasets, and, importantly, learn how to effectively interrogate, explore, and analyse gathered information to generate visualisations.
