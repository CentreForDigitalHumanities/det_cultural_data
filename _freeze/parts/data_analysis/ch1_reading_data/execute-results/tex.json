This means opening the file where the data is currently stored and transfer that data here, in our working environment. As we are working with Python in this Jupyter notebook environment, this means transfering all the data into a Python object. Which object? There are Python libraries (Python code written by other developers) that have been specifically designed to perform the task of data analysis. One of these libraries, or (\"Pythonically\" speaking) **packages**, is called ```pandas```. We will use one of the many ```pandas``` functions to read our ```.csv``` (coma separated values file) file and we will store the information into a pandas ```DataFrame```. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\n<IPython.core.display.HTML object>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\ndata_file = 'data/data.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(data_file)\nprint(type(df))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe managed to transfer our data into a Python object, specifically a ```pandas.core.frame.DataFrame```, or simply (from now on) a DataFrame. However, a lot of things can go wrong when going from one format to another, so it is a good idea to have a first look at the data.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=4}\n```\n<IPython.core.display.HTML object>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndf.head(10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=5}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Year of arrival at port of disembarkation</th>\n      <th>Voyage ID</th>\n      <th>Vessel name</th>\n      <th>Voyage itinerary imputed port where began (ptdepimp) place</th>\n      <th>Voyage itinerary imputed principal place of slave purchase (mjbyptimp)</th>\n      <th>Voyage itinerary imputed principal port of slave disembarkation (mjslptimp) place</th>\n      <th>VOYAGEID2</th>\n      <th>Captives arrived at 1st port</th>\n      <th>Captain's name</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1714.0</td>\n      <td>16109</td>\n      <td>Freeke Gally</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Kingston</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>283.0</td>\n      <td>Neale, Alexander</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>1713.0</td>\n      <td>16110</td>\n      <td>Greyhound Gally</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Jamaica, place unspecified</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Selkirk, Alexander&lt;br/&gt; Forrest, Henry</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>1714.0</td>\n      <td>16111</td>\n      <td>Jacob</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Kingston</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>130.0</td>\n      <td>Nicholls, Philip</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>1714.0</td>\n      <td>16112</td>\n      <td>Jason Gally</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Port Royal</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>278.0</td>\n      <td>Plummer, John</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>1713.0</td>\n      <td>16113</td>\n      <td>Lawford Gally</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>Africa, port unspecified</td>\n      <td>Newcastle (Nevis)</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Stretton, Joseph</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>1714.0</td>\n      <td>16114</td>\n      <td>Mercy Gally</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>Africa, port unspecified</td>\n      <td>Barbados, place unspecified</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>190.0</td>\n      <td>Scott, John</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>1714.0</td>\n      <td>16115</td>\n      <td>Mermaid Gally</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>Cape Verde Islands</td>\n      <td>Kingston</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>72.0</td>\n      <td>Banbury, John&lt;br/&gt; Copinger, James</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>1713.0</td>\n      <td>16116</td>\n      <td>Morning Star</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>Africa, port unspecified</td>\n      <td>Charleston</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>Poole, Nicholas</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>1714.0</td>\n      <td>16117</td>\n      <td>Peterborough</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>Africa, port unspecified</td>\n      <td>Barbados, place unspecified</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>200.0</td>\n      <td>Shawe, John&lt;br/&gt; Martin, Joseph</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9</th>\n      <td>1713.0</td>\n      <td>16118</td>\n      <td>Resolution</td>\n      <td>Bristol</td>\n      <td>Gold Coast, port unspecified</td>\n      <td>Barbados, place unspecified</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>255.0</td>\n      <td>Williams, Charles</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nComparing what we see here with our .csv file it seems that everything went well. We have the data organised in rows and columns. Each column has a name and each row and index. Looking at our data, some values are numbers, some are names and places, some contain htmlo tags, some are NaN. It is not time yet to run data analysis, after having loaded the data we still need to correctly interpret the information it contains, then we need to \"clean\" it, and after that, finally, we can proceed with some data analysis. This is just the beginning, but the best is yet to come!\n\n",
